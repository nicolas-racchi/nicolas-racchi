### Hi. I'm Nicolas.

I'm an *Italian boy* ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ studying **Automation Engineering**. I'm passionate about **Robotics** and **Machine Learning**, and I'm teaching myself **Web Development** through building side projects. You can read more things about me on **[my blog](https://www.nicolasracchi.com)**, where I share some interesting bits of what I'm currently working on. 

My last project is **[SaaS4Devs](https://www.github.com/nicolas-racchi/SaaS4Devs)**, a public repository where I've tried to gather and summarize the main aspects of building a SaaS business as a bootstrapped founder.
